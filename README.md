Creepy Robot Head
=================

History
-------

The Creepy Robot Head is prank that has gotten way out of hand.

I initially wanted to dabble with OpenCV a bit.  The very first version was made out of a couple of extra servos, an arduino, webcam, cardboard, and a Halloween mask.  The goal was simply to make something that would "look" at you, and hopefully make you feel kind of creeped out when it did.  And it did that very well.

But it being made out of scraps, it was pretty fragile.  So I decided to design a new version from the ground up.

That's all there is for the moment.  Things are a mess right now...
